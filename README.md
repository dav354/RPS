# Overview

## Hardware

To run this setup, you will need the following parts:
- Pepper Robot (v2.9)
- Raspberry Pi (We use the Pi5 with 8G Ram, which is overkill):
  - SD-Card
  - Powersupply
  - Google Coral Tpu USB
  - RPi Cooler

And you need to ensure to connect both, the Pi and the Pepper to the same Network.

## Software

This setup constists of three parts:

- **Game Server**

  This is the main logic handling the compute and game logic

- **Pepper API**

  This script is running in the head of the pepper robot and provides the API for the camera and movements.

- **Model Training**

  [This repo](https://github.com/dav354/model_training) contains the training script and data to build the custom ai model

# Setup

## Venv

To develop you need to setup **python3.10** and create the venv.

```shell
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Install edge tpu repo

Then you need to ensure you have the coral tpu dependencies installed.

```shell
echo "deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt coral-edgetpu-stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/coral-edgetpu.list
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install edgetpu-compiler
```

## Pi installation with ansible

To setup the pi there is a small ansbile script. To run it you need to install ansible.

> [!NOTE]
> This step assumes you installed ubuntu24.04

1. First install the required galaxy roles:
  
  ```shell
  ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.docker
  ```

2. Now you can execute the the playbooK:

  ```shell
  ansible-playbook -i '192.168.0.189,' -u david setup_pi.yml -Kk --diff
  ```

## Manual Build

to build the docker image locally run:

```shell
docker buildx create --name multiarch-builder --driver docker-container --use
docker buildx build \
  --builder multiarch-builder \
  --platform linux/arm64 \
  --load \
  -t seminar:latest \
  .
```

### PI Wifi Cli

```bash
# sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-wlan.yaml

network:
  version: 2
  wifis:
    wlan0:
      optional: true
      access-points:
        "HUAWEI-0100T4":
          password: "YourPassword"
      dhcp4: true
```

and then apply the config

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/01-wlan.yaml
sudo netplan apply
```
